# AI Infrastructure Inspection Data Pipeline

This project simulates an **AI-enabled infrastructure inspection pipeline**, designed to process inspection data from drones and sensors, including video, voice-tagged defect events, and localization data.

## Features
- Python-based backend with **REST API** to record inspection defects
- Structured storage using **SQLite** and **SQLAlchemy**
- **CSV export** for engineer-ready inspection reports
- Designed to integrate **speech-to-text**, 360° video, and localization data
- Lightweight and extendable for AI-assisted inspection workflows

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy
- REST APIs

## Use Case
Simulates a workflow where engineers can **ingest raw inspection data** and **generate structured defect tables**.  
Matches industry AI inspection pipelines for bridges and vertical structures.

## Skills Demonstrated
- End-to-end **data pipeline development**
- Handling **media and structured data**
- API design and integration
- Database modeling and CSV reporting
- Engineer-focused workflow design
